# Source Quality Rubric

Classify sources into tiers and prioritize higher quality evidence.

## Tier A (Highest)
- Primary sources: government data, standards bodies, peer-reviewed papers
- Official filings: annual reports, regulatory filings, audited statements
- First-party datasets with transparent methodology

## Tier B (Reliable)
- Reputable news organizations with editorial standards
- Industry analyst reports with clear methodology
- Company technical blogs with data and disclosures

## Tier C (Use Sparingly)
- Opinion pieces without evidence
- Marketing materials without verification
- Aggregators without clear sourcing

## Exclusion Rules
- Exclude sources with no date or author
- Exclude sources that cannot be verified
- Exclude sources that are clearly outdated for the topic

## Conflict Handling
- Surface conflicting sources explicitly
- Prefer higher tier sources
- Note uncertainty when conflicts remain
