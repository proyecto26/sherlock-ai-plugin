## Example Opening

```
This paper proposes Engram, a sparse architecture based on conditional memory.
The method integrates an N-gram lookup mechanism with a Transformer backbone,
enabling O(1)-complexity static knowledge retrieval through scalable hash-based indexing.

Unlike the dynamic routing used in traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models,
Engram’s retrieval index is fully determined by input tokens, providing determinism
and enabling prefetching.
