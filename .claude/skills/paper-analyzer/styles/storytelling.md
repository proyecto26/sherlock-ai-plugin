# storytelling

Down-to-earth and intuitive, written like a story rather than a technical document

## Writing Characteristics

- Starts from questions and intuition, not technology
- Uses vivid metaphors to make abstract concepts concrete
- Follows a single simple example throughout the article
- Builds logic progressively, step by step

## Language Style

- Conversational tone, like talking with a friend
- Uses prompts such as “have you ever thought about…” or “put simply…”
- Allows personal opinions and PS-style remarks
- Avoids academic or overly formal language

## Structural Characteristics

- Intuitive introduction → Background knowledge → Core innovation → Experimental validation → Reflections and outlook
- Every technical point starts with “why this is needed”
- Uses analogies to connect old concepts with new ones

## Example Opening

```
Have you ever thought about this question: when we ask ChatGPT,
“what is the capital of China?”, how does it know the answer?

Intuitively, we might think the model has “memorized” this knowledge.
But in reality, large language models don’t have a true “memory module” at all—
every answer is something they compute.

And this approach has an obvious problem: using a cannon to kill a mosquito.

## Applicable Scenarios

Technical blogs, public tech newsletters, popular science sharing
