# concise

Concise and direct, focused on key points, designed for fast reading

## Writing Characteristics

- Goes straight to the core, omitting lengthy build-up
- One key point per paragraph, no extended elaboration
- Uses tables and lists to increase information density
- Suitable for readers with existing background knowledge

## Language Style

- Short sentences, avoids nested clauses
- States conclusions first, then provides evidence
- Uses cue phrases such as “the core idea is” and “the key point lies in”
- Avoids metaphors and storytelling

## Structural Characteristics

- One-sentence summary → Core innovations → Key results → Limitations
- Heavy use of comparative tables
- Each section limited to 2–3 paragraphs

## Example Opening

```
**Core innovation**: Engram introduces an O(1) lookup mechanism into Transformers,
separating static knowledge from computation.

**Key designs**:
- N-gram hash retrieval: multi-head hashing mapped to embedding tables
- Context gating: hidden states determine whether memory is used
- Deterministic indexing: enables prefetching, inference overhead <3%

**Main results**: +3.4 on MMLU, +5.0 on BBH at equal parameter count
```

## Applicable Scenarios

Quick understanding, paper overviews, technical research
