# no-formulas

Pure text description without including formula images

## Usage

- Describe algorithmic ideas using natural language
- Avoid mathematical symbols and formulas
- Emphasize intuitive understanding rather than mathematical details
- Suitable for readers without a technical background

## Example

```markdown
Engram constructs its memory vectors as follows:
short phrases composed of preceding tokens are mapped to different table entries
through multiple hash functions, and the retrieved vectors are then concatenated.
The advantage of this design is that the table capacity can be expanded freely
without affecting query speed.
```

## Applicable Scenarios

Popular science articles, non-technical audiences, quick overviews
